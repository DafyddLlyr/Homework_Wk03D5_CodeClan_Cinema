### Your app should be able to:
  - [x]Create customers, films and tickets
  - [x]CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) customers, films and tickets.
  - [x]Show which films a customer has booked to see, and see which customers are coming to see one film. At least one of these should return the data ordered by a property (customers or films ordered by name/title, for instance).

### Basic extensions:
  - [x]Buying tickets should decrease the funds of the customer by the price
  - [x]Check how many tickets were bought by a customer
  - [x]Check how many customers are going to watch a certain film

### Advanced extensions:
  - [x]Create a screenings table that lets us know what time films are showing
  - [x]Write a method that finds out what is the most popular time (most tickets sold) for a given film
  - [x]Limit the available tickets for screenings.
  - [x]Add any other extensions you think would be great to have at a cinema!
